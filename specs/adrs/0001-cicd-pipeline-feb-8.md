## Context and Problem Statement
We want to choose what structure we want to use for the CI/CD pipeline:
1. code quality via tool  (ex. Codeclimate, Codacy, etc.)
2. code quality via human review (ex. Pull Requests)
3. unit tests via automation (ex. Jest, Tape, Ava, Cypress, Mocha/Chai, etc.)*
4. documentation generation via automation (ex. JSDocs)


## Considered Options

* Code quality via tool
  * Codeclimate
  * Codacy
* Code quality via human review
  * Pull Requests
* Unit tests via automation
  * Jest
  * Tape
  * Ava
  * Cypress
  * Mocha/Chai
* Documentation generation via automation
  * JSDocs

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].
