# Meeting Minutes: Group 23

- Topic: Starting Pitch
- Location: Zoom
- Time: 6:30 PM - 10:00 PM

### Agenda

1. Set boundaries (featureset, time for each)
   - raw idea
     - appetite (batch into importance big, small)
   - Fixed time, come up with idea that can be made within the time scheme
   - Be specific about the problem
2. Rough out the elements (draw on ipad, etc)
   - avoid wrong level of detail; no wireframes/specific layouts
   - more clarity than fat marker sketch (for our project)
   - breadboard: key components/interactions needed, no visual design
     - places: screens, dialogs, menus
     - afforances: buttons/fields/information
     - connections to take user from place to place
3. Risks and rabbit holes (holes or unanswered questions, specify details or amend solutions)
   - walk through use case in slow motion
   - mark specific things out of bounds
   - cut back on unecessary ideas
4. Write pitch in /specs/pitch
   - problem
     - /specs/users
       - personas
       - user stories
       - use cases
     - raw idea to solve user issue
   - appetite/constrains
     - time to spend on each project, how that constrains solution
   - solution
     - /specs/interface/rough
       - fat marker design
     - /specs/interface/wireframes
       - wireframes
     - specs/interface/highfidelity
       - high fidelity prototypes
     - system diagrams
       - c4/uml/event modeling
     - embedded sketches
     - annotated fat marker sketches
   - rabbit holes
     - details to call out to avoid problems
     - and how they were resolved
   - limitations/no gos
     - what we're NOT doing
     - /specs/roadmap.md
       - project roadmap

CI/CD Phase 1:

- Linting and code style
- code quality via tool (codeclimate, codeacy)
- code quality via review (pull requests)
- unit tests via automation (jest, tape, ava, cypress, mocha/chai)
- automatic documentation generation (jsdocs)
