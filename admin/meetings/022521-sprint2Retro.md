# Pomodore timer First Sprint Retrospective

## Time: Feb.8th - Feb.19th (2 Weeks)
## Members: team 23 - Whatever you want

## Tasks Accomplished
  - Settings got CSS mostly done, and variables in js for each of the settings
    - only thing callback functions for setting variables
  - info box is up and running, need to fill in with relevant information
  - timer now switches between breaks and work sessions, still need to implement transitions
## What went well in the Sprint
  - Division of labor was good
  - not too many interdependencies
  - github issues was used well
  - communication between teams was easier since small groups
  - more efficient
## What could be improved
  - github issues should be more descriptive of final functionality
  - if issue spans multiple sprints (out of scope for one sprint, indicate division)
  - compartmentalize css files
