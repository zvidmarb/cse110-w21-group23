# Pomodore timer First Sprint Retrospective

## Time: Feb.21th - Ma.5th (2 Weeks)
## Members: team 23 - Whatever you want

## Tasks Accomplished
  - Info box merged to the master branch
  - Layout of the site change done
  - Setting done
  - Most of tasks list done

  
## What went well in the Sprint
  - Division of labor was good: resonable task delegation
  - not too many interdependencies
  - github issues was used well
  - communication between teams was easier since small groups
  - Having clear deadline of what things should be done by whom
  - assige each feature to small groups, and each small group has their separate meeting and working seesions, which helps to get the work done.
    i.e. task list group and info box group
 
## What could be improved
  - more efficient meeting: Solve all conflicts and merge the new feature to master branch before the meeting. So the rest teammates do not have to
    there and wath you do that.
  - Uderestimate the time takes for the task list, should modify the plan as the work goes, and we could split for more people to make that little easier.
  - Linting is wacky, should fix earlier.
  - github issues should be more descriptive of final functionality
  - if issue spans multiple sprints (out of scope for one sprint, indicate division)
  - compartmentalize css files
